#+title: Computer Configuration
This chapter begins the journey through some of the many helpful tools that can improve your everyday workflow on the computer.
* Dotfiles
My computer configuration is available on GitLab and GitHub:
- [[https://gitlab.com/ody55eus/dotfiles]]
- [[https://github.com/ody55eus/dotfiles]]
* Editing Text Files
** Version Control
All files which change over time should be version controlled. The most easy way to do this is with [[id:fc8ee5a9-57d9-4349-9428-5df19fcdf3e5][Git]].
** Text Editors
*** Vim
*** Emacs
**** Org Mode

 The book [[id:f80807b8-91f4-4799-92a3-076d1c1a045a][How to take smart notes]] inspired me to rethink my note taking system. With Org Roam, I found a great way to simply take notes and link them together. This is also the basis for this website.
