#+TITLE: Ody55eus - About Me

Dear visitor,

welcome to my odyssey through science. This little corner of the web lets you follow me on my way as I stumble across numerous phenomena in multidisciplinary fields.

This web-page is constantly growing and improving.

* About Me
My name is Jonathan Pieper, I am a researcher in physics, data science, and machine learning. I finished my masterâ€™s degree at Goethe University Frankfurt in 2021. I am currently searching for new projects to advance science.

I majored in physics with focus on information technology. During my academic studies, I focused on solid state physics to retrace how computers intrinsically operate.
During my bachelor and [[id:c3b47664-b69b-4eb2-a09f-66325d5566fe][master thesis]], I studied the magnetic nature of novel nanostructures and their intrinsic statistical behavior.
In this process, I focused on statistical data analysis, scrutinizing noisy signals in detail with fluctuation spectroscopy, observing the frequency space of fluctuations using Fourier transformation.
