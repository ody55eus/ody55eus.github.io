#+title: Org Roam (Zettelkasten)

 The book [[id:f80807b8-91f4-4799-92a3-076d1c1a045a][How to take smart notes]] inspired me to overthink my (non-existent) note taking system. The Emacs package [[id:5064b908-04f6-4167-a66c-072073109ef1][Org Roam]] (an extension for [[id:afe3de83-e5b8-4f53-b457-987dd9bd579d][Org Mode]]), which just released the new major version 2.0 at that moment, is the tool of choice for me to implement the Zettelkasten system on my computer.
The Zettelkasten system became popular by the German sociologist Niklas Luhman and books like [[id:f80807b8-91f4-4799-92a3-076d1c1a045a][How to take smart notes]].
Org Roam provides a simple digital implementation of this principle to manage and link digital notes in plain text format.
