#+title: Vim

Vim (Vi IMproved) is one of the oldest and most powerful keyboard driven text editors.
Please take a look at my [[id:c44ddac4-82c6-410c-b07b-e703379a3af1][Computer Configuration]] to see, how I am using Vim.

* Vi Movement
The first hurdle for most new users is to learn the different Vi modes (Normal, Insert, Visual and Command Mode).
To insert text into a document, the keys ~i~ (insert) or ~a~ (append) can change from normal to insert mode (~ESC~ always returns back to normal mode). The command mode allows entering Vim specific commands which usually start with a colon (~:~).
To learn the basic Vim keybindings, try the vim-tutor (with the command ~:Tutor~).

When moving through a text file, usually the *normal mode* is used. This mode provides the following keybindings (this list is not complete. For a complete list, consult the Vim help via ~:help~):
