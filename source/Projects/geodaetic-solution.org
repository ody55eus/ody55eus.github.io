#+title: Geodaetic solution to an initial values problem
#+filetags: :Star:

This project is the result of a small project for the German lecture on [[https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~hanauske/VARTC/][general relativity theory]] by [[https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~hanauske/][Dr. Matthias Hanauske]].

It can solve the geodaetic equations of a single body moving around a black hole.

* Example
The following video displays the numeric solution to an initial values problem for a single body in the gravitational pull of a black hole:
