I have created the following project for the course Data Science by [[https://www.dbis.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/index.php/staff/][Dr. Karsten Tolle]].

* Goal

This code is traning two models to classify an image into one of the following groups:
- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Rose
- Sunflower
- Tulip

* Data

This code is trained on the images from the following Datasets:
+ https://www.kaggle.com/mgornergoogle/five-flowers
+ https://www.kaggle.com/ianmoone0617/flower-goggle-tpu-classification

* Training the model

The training was processed with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xMJ1Kt4YBeIpqGIzPt1Km8ziwNW5a2Og) to take advantage of the fast computation with GPU.

* Results
