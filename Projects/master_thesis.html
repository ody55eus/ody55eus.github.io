<p>
The detailed understanding of micro&#x2013;and nanoscale structures,
in particular their magnetization dynamics,
dominates contemporary solid&#x2013;state physics studies.
Most investigations already identified an abundance of phenomena in one&#x2013;and two&#x2013;dimensional nanostructures.
The following thesis focuses on the magnetic fingerprint of three&#x2013;dimensional \(\mathrm{CoFe}\) nano&#x2013;magnets,
specifically the temporal development of their hysteresis loop.
These nano&#x2013;magnets were grown in a tetrahedral pattern on top of a highly susceptible home&#x2013;build \(\mathrm{GaAs}/\mathrm{AlGaAs}\) micro&#x2013;Hall sensor using focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID).
</p>

<p>
During the measurements, utmost efforts were employed to exemplify current best research practices.
The data life cycle of the present thesis is based upon open&#x2013;source data science tools and packages.
Data acquisition and analysis required self&#x2013;written automated algorithms
to handle the extensive quantity of data.
Existing instrumental&#x2013;controlling software was improved, and new Python packages were devised to analyze and visualize the gathered data.
The open&#x2013;source Python data analysis framework (<code>ana</code>) was developed
to facilitate computational reproducibility.
This framework transparently analyses and visualizes the gathered data automatically using Continuous Analysis tools based on GitLab and Continuous Integration.
This automatization uses bespoke scripts combined with virtualization tools like Docker to facilitate reproducible and device&#x2013;independent results.
</p>

<p>
The hysteresis loops reveal distinct differences in subsequently measured loops with identical initial experimental parameters,
originating from the nano&#x2013;magnet’s magnetic noise.
This noise amplifies in regions where switching processes occur.
In such noise&#x2013;prone regions, the time&#x2013;dependent scrutinization reveals presumably thermally induced metastable magnetization states.
The frequency&#x2013;dependent power spectral density uncovers a characteristic \(1/f^2\) behavior at noise&#x2013;prone regions with metastable magnetization states.

<p>
The present study aims to
find and characterize fluctuations
in the magnetic fingerprint
of three&#x2013;dimensional nano&#x2013;tetrapods.
These tetrapods were deposited by means of focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID)
on top of a micro&#x2013;Hall magnetometer.
The micro&#x2013;Hall measurements
scrutinized the magnetic fingerprint
by measuring the nanostructures’ stray&#x2013;field
during an external field sweep
and obtaining the hysteresis loop.
Repetitions of identical experiments
yield several, nearly equivalent
hysteresis loops that differ in noise&#x2013;prone regions
near the remanence.
These noise&#x2013;prone regions are further investigated
using statistical methods
to determine the noise’s power spectral density (PSD).
</p>

<p>
During the process of data acquisition and analysis,
utmost efforts were employed
to comply with current best research practices.
In general,
the data processing steps
involve customized, self&#x2013;written computer algorithms
that are freely available
and fundamentally documented.
Based on experiences,
the workflow&rsquo;s documentation process
evolved
from proprietary OneNote notebooks
towards an open&#x2013;source driven
Continuous Analysis infrastructure,
allowing automated data analysis
and interoperable documentation.
In detail,
a self&#x2013;maintained GitLab server
provides the infrastructure
to manage git repositories
that version&#x2013;control
data, code, and documentation.
In addition,
Continuous Integration tools
automate tasks
and increase productivity.
These aforementioned data processing
and workflow steps have been
fundamentally documented,
converted into a presentable format,
and made online available via the supplemental information.

<p>
The noise investigations
utilized two separate methods
to dissect the Hall signal of the
nano&#x2013;tetrapods during an external field sweep.
Firstly,
a signal&#x2013;analyzer
examines the signal’s
PSD \(S_V (f)\) in the frequency domain.
This examination discloses a
\(1/f^2\) correlation of the PSD
only when measuring the stray&#x2013;field
during an external magnetic field sweep
inside a noise&#x2013;prone region.
This correlation is noteably invariant
to changes in the temperature or sweeprate.
A novel data acquisition technique (SR830DAQ)
further scrutinizes this fluctuating nature
of the nano&#x2013;tetrapods’ magnetic response.
This SR830DAQ technique corroborates
preceding findings on \(1/f^2\) correlations.
Additionally,
sensitive fluctuations,
although not detectable in a pre&#x2013;amplified signal with the signal&#x2013;analyzer,
measured by the SR830DAQ technique,
reveal a \(S_V \sim I^2\) current dependence of the PSD and
confirming expectations.
Closer inspection of
the persisting time&#x2013;signal
of interrupted field sweeps
inside the hysteresis loop’s noise&#x2013;prone regions
exposes metastable magnetization states
with spontaneous switching processes.
The author deduces
that this spontaneous switching
originates from thermal activation processes.
